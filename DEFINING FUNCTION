;; This is a simple Lisp program that defines a function
;; to add two numbers and then calls that function.

;; Define a function called 'add' that takes two arguments, 'a' and 'b'.
(defun add (a b)
  ;; The body of the function simply adds 'a' and 'b'.
  (+ a b))

;; Call the 'add' function with the arguments 5 and 3.
;; The result of the function call will be printed to the console.
(print (add 5 3))
